# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It was conducted to test how GitHub works some time ago, but I decided to re-uploaded again.

The project only has two .py files: one creates functions, the other one calls them. The final output is a report that counts the number of words (and other basic stuff) for any given book stored in a .txt file.
