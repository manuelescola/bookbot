# 🤖 BookBot  

BookBot is my first project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)! 🚀  

Originally created to experiment with **GitHub**, I decided to **re-upload** it to preserve its functionality and showcase the work.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
📂 The project consists of **two Python (.py) files**:  
- One file **defines functions** 🛠️  
- The other **executes them** 📜  

## 📊 What BookBot Does  
- 📖 Reads any **.txt book file**  
- 📝 Counts the **total words** & other basic statistics  
- 📑 Generates a **detailed report**  

This simple yet effective script provides insight into **text analysis** and **basic automation with Python**! 🐍
