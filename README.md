🤖 BookBot

BookBot is my first project from Boot.dev! 🚀


Originally created to experiment with GitHub, I decided to re-upload it to preserve its functionality and showcase the work.

📌 Project Overview:

📂 The project consists of two Python (.py) files:

- 🔹 One file defines functions 🛠️

- 🔹 The other executes them 📜


📊 What BookBot Does:

- 📖 Reads any .txt book file

- 📝 Counts the total words & other basic statistics

- 📑 Generates a detailed report


This simple yet effective script provides insight into text analysis and basic automation with Python! 🐍
